# Predictive Text Model with ChatGPT Integration
## Objective:
This task is to develop a basic predictive text model and integrate it with ChatGPT to enhance
text generation capabilities.
## Task Overview:
### Predictive Text Model:
1. Choose a dataset (e.g., a collection of sentences or paragraphs) for training your
predictive text model.
2. Use a machine learning library of your choice (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train a basic
language model capable of predicting the next word in a sequence.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using a validation set or any appropriate metric.
### ChatGPT Integration:
1. Integrate your predictive text model with ChatGPT to create a text completion system.
2. When a user enters a partial sentence, your predictive text model should predict the next
word(s), and ChatGPT should generate the rest of the sentence.
3. Ensure a seamless interaction between your model and ChatGPT.
